#Accessing the lists elements. ----> In this topic we are goin to study about indexing.

Fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
print(Fruits) 
print(Fruits[0])
print(Fruits[-1])


Name = ["Abhinas", "Harry", "Bob"]
print(Name)
print(Name[1])
print(Name[-1])

#Here in the above code we knew that indexing starts from 0 for first data-type value in lists and negetive indexing for the last data-type value in the lists.
